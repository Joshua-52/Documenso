# What is 21 CFR Part 11

intro 21 cfr

Regulatory Framework for Electronic Records and Signatures:
21 CFR Part 11 is a regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that establishes the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered trustworthy, reliable, and equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures. It applies to all FDA-regulated industries, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and biologics.

Requirements for Compliance:
The regulation outlines specific requirements for the validation of electronic systems, ensuring data integrity, and security measures. This includes guidelines for system access controls, audit trails, data encryption, and periodic system checks to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that records are accurate and unaltered.

Impact on Business Processes:
Compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 is crucial for companies to legally use electronic records and signatures in their operations. This affects how companies manage documentation, conduct audits, and maintain regulatory submissions. Non-compliance can result in legal penalties, rejected submissions, and delays in product approvals, emphasizing the importance of adhering to these guidelines in FDA-regulated activities.
