# Send Documents for Signing

This guide will walk you through the process of sending a document out for signature using Documenso. You will learn how to upload a document, add recipients, place signature fields, and send the document for signing.

<Steps>
### Login Into Your Account

The guide assumes you have a Documenso account. If you don't, you can create a free account [here](https://documen.so/free-docs).

### Upload Document

Navigate to the [Documenso dashboard](https://app.documenso.com/documents) and click on the "Add a document" button. Select the document you want to upload and wait for the upload to complete.

![Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/documenso-documents-dashboard.webp)

After the upload is complete, you will be redirected to the document's page. Here, you can configure the document's settings and add recipients and fields.

![Documenso document overview](public/document-signing/documenso-uploaded-document.webp)

### (Optional) Advanced Options

Click on the "Advanced options" button to access additional settings for the document. You can set an external ID, date format, time zone, and the redirect URL.

![Advanced settings for a document uploaded in the Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/documenso-uploaded-document-advanced-options.webp)

The external ID allows you to set a custom ID for the document that can be used to identify the document in your external system(s).

The date format and time zone settings allow you to customize how the date and time are displayed in the document.

The redirect URL allows you to specify a URL where the signer will be redirected after signing the document.

### (Optional) Document Access

Documenso enables you to set up access control for your documents. You can require authentication for viewing the document.

The available options are:

- **Require account** - The recipient must be signed in to view the document.
- **None** - The document can be accessed directly by the URL sent to the recipient.

![Document access settings in the Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/documenso-enterprise-document-access.webp)

<Callout type="info">
  The "Document Access" feature is only available for Enterprise accounts.
</Callout>

### (Optional) Recipient Authentication

The "Recipient Authentication" feature allows you to specify the authentication method required for recipients to sign the signature field.

The available options are:

- **Require passkey** - The recipient must have an account and passkey configured via their settings.
- **Require 2FA** - The recipient must have an account and 2FA enabled via their settings.
- **None** - No authentication required.

![Document recipient action authentication in the Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/document-enterprise-recipient-action-authentication.webp)

This can be overridden by setting the authentication requirements directly for each recipient in the next step.

<Callout type="info">
  The "Recipient Authentication" feature is only available for Enterprise accounts.
</Callout>

### Recipients

Click the "+ Add Signer" button to add a new recipient. You can configure the recipient's email address, name, role, and authentication method on this page.

You can choose any option from the ["Recipient Authentication"](optional-recipient-authentication) section, or you can set it to "Inherit authentication method" to use the global action signing authentication method configured in the "General Settings" step.

![The required authentication method for a recipient](public/document-signing/documenso-document-recipient-authentication-method.webp)

You can also set the recipient's role, which determines their actions and permissions in the document.

![The recipient role](public/document-signing/documenso-document-recipient-role.webp)

#### Roles

Documenso has 4 roles for recipients with different permissions and actions.

|   Role   |                                    Function                                     | Action required | Signature |

### Fields

Documenso supports 9 different field types that can be added to the document. Each field type collects various information from the recipients when they sign the document.

After entering the date, the recipient can click the "Complete" button to complete the signing process.

#### Text Field

The text field is used for collecting text input from the signer.

##### Document Editor View

Place the text field on the document where you want the signer to enter text. The text field comes with additional settings that can be configured.

![The text field in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/text-field-document-editor-view.webp)

To open the settings, click on the text field and then on the "Sliders" icon. That opens the settings panel on the right side of the screen.

![The text field settings in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/text-field-advanced-settings-document-editor-view.webp)

The text field settings include:

- Label - The label displayed on the field
- Placeholder - The placeholder text displayed in the field
- Text - The default text displayed in the field
- Character limit - The maximum number of characters allowed in the field
- Required - Whether the field is required or not
- Read only - Whether the field is read-only or not

It also comes with a couple of rules:

- The field can't be required and read-only at the same time.
- A read-only field can't have an empty text field. It must have a default text value.
- A required field must be filled in by the signer.
- The text field count can't be higher than the character limit.
- A read-only field can't be modified by the signer.
- The field auto-signs if there is a default text value.

Let's look at the following example.

![A text field with the settings configured by the user in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/text-field-with-filled-advanced-settings.webp)

The field is configured as follows:

- Label: "Address"
- Placeholder: "Your office address"
- Default Text: "Signing Street 1, 241245"
- Character Limit: 35
- Required: False
- Read Only: False

Since the field has a label set, the label is displayed instead of the default text field value - "Add text".

##### Document Signing View

What the recipient sees when they open the document to sign depends on the settings configured by the sender.

In this case, the recipient sees the text field signed with the default value.

![Text field with the default value signed by the user in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/text-field-autosigned.webp)

The recipient can modify the text field value since the field is not read-only. To change the value, the recipient needs to click on the field to un-sign it.

Once it's unsigned, the field uses the label set by the sender.

![Unsigned text field in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/text-field-unsigned.webp)

To sign the field with a different value, the recipient needs to click on the field and enter the new value.

![Text field with the text input in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/text-field-input-modal.webp)

Since the text field has a character limit, the recipient needs to enter a value that doesn't exceed the limit. Otherwise, it will show an error message and the field won't be signed.

The image below illustrates the text field signed with a new value.

![Text field signed with a new value](public/document-signing/text-field-new-value-signed.webp)

After signing the field, the recipient can click the "Complete" button to complete the signing process.

#### Number Field

The number field is used for collecting a number input from the signer.

##### Document Editor View

Place the number field on the document where you want the signer to enter a number. The number field comes with additional settings that can be configured.

![The number field in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/number-field-document-editor.webp)

To open the settings, click on the number field and then on the "Sliders" icon. That opens the settings panel on the right side of the screen.

![The number field in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/number-field-document-editor-view.webp)

The number field settings include:

- Label - The label displayed on the field
- Placeholder - The placeholder text displayed in the field
- Value - The default number displayed in the field
- Number format - The format of the number
- Required - Whether the field is required or not
- Read only - Whether the field is read-only or not
- Validation - The validation rules for the field

It also comes with a couple of rules:

- The value must be a number.
- The field can't be required and read-only at the same time.
- A read-only field can't have an empty number field. It must have a default number value.
- A required field must be filled in by the signer.
- If the default number and a max value are set, the default number must be less than the max value.
- If the default number and a min value are set, the default number must be greater than the min value.
- The value must match the number format.

In this example, the number field is configured as follows:

- Label: "Quantity"
- Placeholder: "Enter the preferred quantity"
- Default Value: 12
- Number Format: "123,456,789.00"
- Required: False
- Read Only: False
- Validation:
  - Min value: 5, Max value: 50

![A number field with the label configured by the user in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/number-field-label.webp)

Since the field has a label set, the label is displayed instead of the default number field value - "Add number".

##### Document Signing View

What the recipient sees when they open the document to sign depends on the settings configured by the sender.

In this case, the recipient sees the number field signed with the default value.

![Number field with the default value signed by the user in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/number-field-autosigned.webp)

The recipient can modify the number field value since the field is not read-only. To change the value, the recipient needs to click on the field to un-sign it.

Once it's unsigned, the field uses the label set by the sender.

![Unsigned number field in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/number-field-unsigned.webp)

To sign the field with a different value, the recipient needs to click on the field and enter the new value.

![Number field with the number input in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/number-field-input-modal.webp)

Since the number field has a validation rule set, the recipient needs to enter a value that meets the validation rules. In this example, the value needs to be between 5 and 50. Otherwise, it will show an error message and the field won't be signed.

The image below illustrates the text field signed with a new value.

![Number field signed with a new value](public/document-signing/number-field-signed-with-another-value.webp)

After signing the field, the recipient can click the "Complete" button to complete the signing process.

#### Radio Field

##### Document Editor View

##### Document Signing View

#### Checkbox Field

##### Document Editor View

##### Document Signing View

#### Dropdown/Select Field

The dropdown/select field is used for collecting a single choice from a list of choices.

##### Document Editor View

Place the dropdown/select field on the document where you want the signer to select a choice. The dropdown/select field comes with additional settings that can be configured.

![The dropdown/select field in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/select-field-sliders.webp)

To open the settings, click on the dropdown/select field and then on the "Sliders" icon. That opens the settings panel on the right side of the screen.

![The dropdown/select field settings in the Documenso document editor](public/document-signing/select-field-advanced-settings-panel.webp)

The dropdown/select field settings include:

- Required - Whether the field is required or not
- Read only - Whether the field is read-only or not
- Options - The list of choices for the field
- Default value - The default value selected in the field

It also comes with a couple of rules:

- The field can't be required and read-only at the same time.
- A read-only field can't have an empty select field. It must have a default value.
- A required field must be filled in by the signer.
- The default value must be one of the options.
- The field auto-signs if there is a default value.
- The field can't be signed with a value that is not in the options list.
- The field can't be modified by the signer if it's read-only.
- It should contain at least one option.

In this example, the dropdown/select field is configured as follows:

- Required: False
- Read Only: False
- Default Value: None
- Options:
  - Document
  - Template
  - Other

##### Document Signing View

What the recipient sees when they open the document to sign depends on the settings configured by the sender.

In this case, the recipient sees the dropdown/select field with the default label, "-- Select ---", since there is no default value set by the sender.

![Dropdown/select field  in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/select-field-unsigned.webp)

The recipient can modify the dropdown/select field value since the field is not read-only. To change the value, the recipient needs to click on the field for the dropdown list to appear.

![Dropdown/select field with the dropdown list in the Documenso document signing view](public/document-signing/select-field-unsigned-dropdown.webp)

The recipient can select one of the options from the list. The image below illustrates the dropdown/select field signed with a new value.

![Dropdown/select field signed with a value](public/document-signing/select-field-signed.webp)

After signing the field, the recipient can click the "Complete" button to complete the signing process.

#### Signature Required

Signer Roles require at least 1 signature field. You will get an error message if you try to send a document without a signature field.

![Error message when trying to send a document without a signature field](public/document-signing/documenso-no-signature-field-found.webp)

### Email Settings

Before sending the document, you can configure the email settings and customize the subject line, message, and sender name.

![Email settings in the Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/documenso-document-email-settings.webp)

If you leave the email subject and message empty, Documenso will use the default email template.

### Sending the Document

After configuring the document, click the "Send" button to send the document to the recipients. The recipients will receive an email with a link to sign the document.

![The email sent to the recipients with the signing link](public/document-signing/documenso-sign-email.webp)

#### Signing Link

If you need to copy the signing link for each recipient, you can do so by clicking on the recipient whose link you want to copy. The signing link is copied automatically to your clipboard.

![How to copy the signing link for each recipient from the Documenso dashboard](public/document-signing/documenso-signing-links.webp)

The signing link has the following format:

```bash
https://app.documenso.com/sign/12ACP777zxQLO52hjj_vCB
```
