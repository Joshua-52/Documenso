### Release Notes

Check out what's new in the latest version and read what we think about it. You can find our releases on GitHub for more technical details [here](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases).

## 1.5.4

> This release contains [21 fixes](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases/tag/v1.5.4)

#### 🔑 Passkeys

To improve security and usability for high security setups, we added passykeys with this release. Passkeys can now be used to log in or re-authenticate each siganture for high-compliance cases.

#### 📄 Signing Certificate & Audit Log

On the security/ compliance side we also added Signing Certificates and Audit Logs. Every signed document now has a certificate attached, showing technical details of the signature to improve transparency and security. Further every action on a document from creation to completation is now logged in the audit log to guarantees the integrity of the process.

#### 🔏🦀 @documenso/pdf-sign

We are pretty hyped about this one: Since version 0.9 we relied on https://github.com/vbuch/node-signpdf to add the digital signatures to our documents. Since signing is at the heart of Documenso, we created our own, rust-based, libary for signing. As of 1.5.4 Documenso's signing runs on @documenso/pdf-sign. The libary offers a better architecture to enable signing with private keys, that are not stored locally (e.g. via HSM). We are in process of cleaning up the libary to open source it like the rest of Documenso 🌱 The libary will also help us to offer Long Term Validation (LTV) for signatures soon. While are are currently limited to signing with PKCS7-B, eventually we plan to support all common signing standards like PAdES, CAdES and XAdES.
