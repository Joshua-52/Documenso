# Self-Hosting licenses

Documenso comes in two version for self-hosting:

### [Commuinity Edition (Free)](licenses/community-edition)

- Free
- No official support

### [Enterprise Edition (Paid)](licenses/enterprise-edition)

- Paid
- Official support
- Enterprise Features

Which one is right for you depends on your context. If you need officiall support and enterprise-level compliance you probabaly need the enterprise edition. Please note that the Community Edition has almost no restrictions in terms of features and usecases (even commercially). If you think it offers everything you need, we encourge you to get started with the Community Edition, as upgrading later is always an option.
