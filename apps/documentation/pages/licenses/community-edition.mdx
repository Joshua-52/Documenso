# Community Edtion

> If the community edition offers everything you need, we encourge you to go ahead and use it. We benefit from license fees, but also from a strong community üå±

The Community Edition is meant to allow everyone to run their own signing Infrastructure. You can take Documenso as is and run it yourself with barely any restrictions. We are mindful to keep self-hosting a realistic option and not let the product drift towards cloud ownly. Your are free to create and capture as much value with the Community Edition as you can. The only Limitation we putting in place for now are some enterprise features, mainly needed but big organization, we expect to want official support as part of a paid license anyway.
