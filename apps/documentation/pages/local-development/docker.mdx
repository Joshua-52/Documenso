# Docker

The following guide will walk you through setting up Documenso using Docker. You can choose between a Docker Compose production setup or a standalone container.

We provide a Docker container for Documenso, which is published on both DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry.

- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/documenso/documenso)
- [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/documenso/documenso)

You can pull the Docker image from either of these registries and run it with your preferred container hosting provider.

Please note that you will need to provide environment variables for connecting to the database, mail server, and other services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (if using the Docker Compose setup)

## Option 1: Production Docker Compose Setup

This setup includes a PostgreSQL database and the Documenso application. You will need to provide your own SMTP details using environment variables.

<Steps>

### Download the Docker Compose File

Download the Docker Compose file from the Documenso repository - [compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/documenso/documenso/release/docker/production/compose.yml).

### Navigate to the `compose.yml` File

Once downloaded, navigate to the directory containing the `compose.yml` file.

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `compose.yml` file.

Then add your SMTP details as well as the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-secret>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-key>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY="<your-secondary-key>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL="<your-url>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT="smtp-auth"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_HOST="<your-host>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PORT=<your-port>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_USERNAME="<your-username>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PASSWORD="<your-password>"
```

### Update the Volume Binding

The `cert.p12` file is required to sign and encrypt documents, so you must provide your key file. Update the volume binding in the `compose.yml` file to point to your key file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/keyfile.p12:/opt/documenso/cert.p12
```

After updating the volume binding, save the `compose.yml` file and run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file ./.env -d up
```

The command will start the PostgreSQL database and the Documenso application containers.

### Access the Application

Access the Documenso application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

</Steps>

## Option 2: Standalone Docker Container

If you prefer to host the Documenso application on a specific container provider, you can use the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub or GitHub's Package Registry. Note that you will need to provide your own database and SMTP host.

<Steps>

### Pull the Docker Image

Pull the Documenso Docker image from DockerHub:

```bash
docker pull documenso/documenso
```

Or, pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/documenso/documenso
```

### Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container with the required environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
 -p 3000:3000 \
 -e NEXTAUTH_URL="<your-nextauth-url>"
 -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-nextauth-secret>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-next-private-encryption-key>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY="<your-next-private-encryption-secondary-key>"
 -e NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL="<your-next-public-webapp-url>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL="<your-next-private-database-url>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="<your-next-private-database-url>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT="<your-next-private-smtp-transport>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_NAME="<your-next-private-smtp-from-name>"
 -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS="<your-next-private-smtp-from-address>"
 -v /path/to/your/keyfile.p12:/opt/documenso/cert.p12
 documenso/documenso
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual values.

### Access the Application

Access the Documenso application by visiting the URL you provided for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` environment variable in your web browser.

</Steps>
