Consider setting up 2-Factor-Authentication for logging it to increase security. You can also add a Passkey to make singing in even more secure and convenience. The 2FA and Passkeys in your account are used for high security and high compliance signatures as well.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- Activating 2FA is done by scanning the QR Code presented after clicking 'Enable 2FA'. You can use Google/ Microsoft Authenticator or any other standard 2FA app.
- Be sure to download and safely store the 2FA backup codes in case you loose or damage you 2FA device (e.g. your phone)
- After activating, logging in with your password will prompt you to also enter code, generated in the app you linked above
- Logging in with Google will not trigger a 2FA code. As an authentication provider your Google account is considered secured seperatly. e.g. configuring 2FA for your google account.
- Logging in using a passkey will also not trigger a 2FA code, since passkeys are considered 2FA by design. The passkey itself is the 1st factor and the access to the device to hold it is considered the second factor.

## Passkeys

> A passkey is like a secret password that is stored locally on your device. You can use it to log in from the device it was created on but not from another device.

- To add a passkey, go to the security settings in your account and select passkeys: https://app.documenso.com/settings/security/passkeys
- How you use passkeys is heavily dependen on your system and/ or tools you use e.g. 1password for managing passkeys
- Adding passkeys to your account will prompt you to use the first passkey provider that is found. e.g. if you have the 1password extention in your browser, it will show you the option to add the new passkey
- If you want to choose another place to store the passkey, simply dismiss the dialog (close it) and you will be prompted by the next possible provider e.g. the browser passkey mananger
