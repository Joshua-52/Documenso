# Create Your Account

<Steps>
### Pick a Plan

The first step to start using Documenso is to pick a plan and create an account. At the moment of writing this guide, we have 3 plans available: Free, Individual, and Teams.

Explore the features of each plan and choose the one that best fits your needs. You can find more information about the plans on the [pricing page](https://documen.so/pricing).

### Create an account

If you are unsure which plan to choose, you can start with the free plan and upgrade later.

To create a free account, navigate to the [registration page](https://documen.so/free) and fill in the required information.

### Optional: Claim a Premium Username

You can claim a premium username by upgrading to a paid plan. After upgrading to a paid plan, you can update your [public profile](https://app.documenso.com/settings/public-profile).

### Optional: Create a Team

If you are working with others, you can create a team and invite your team members to collaborate on your documents. More information about teams is in the [Teams section](/get-started/teams).
